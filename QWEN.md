1. Abstract
The Lightweight Social Networking Protocol (LSNP) is a decentralized communication framework that facilitates social networking functionality within local area networks (LANs) without relying on centralized servers or internet connectivity. LSNP leverages the simplicity and efficiency of plaintext, key-value structured messages, and utilizes UDP broadcast and unicast communication methods. This protocol supports a range of peer-to-peer interactions, including dynamic peer discovery, real-time messaging, ad hoc file sharing, and seamless group engagement. Additionally, LSNP enables the deployment of interactive applications such as games and collaborative tools within local networks, offering a low-overhead and scalable approach to localized social networking environments.

2. Introduction
The Lightweight Social Networking Protocol (LSNP) is engineered to operate effectively within disconnected or minimally resourced environments where conventional network infrastructure is constrained or absent. Target deployment scenarios include educational institutions, post-disaster zones, rural communities, and temporary installations such as exhibitions or public events. LSNP facilitates peer-to-peer communication and collaboration within local area networks (LANs), offering essential services such as identity dissemination, messaging, content distribution, and lightweight interaction. Its low overhead and decentralized architecture enable rapid deployment and efficient operation without reliance on centralized servers or persistent internet connectivity.
LSNP adopts a simple, human-readable protocol based on plaintext key-value messaging, utilizing UDP broadcast and unicast for intra-network communication. This design supports dynamic peer discovery, real-time information exchange, and user-driven interactivity within LAN environments. The protocol’s modularity and minimal resource footprint make it suitable for constrained hardware and software platforms, promoting accessibility and extensibility. LSNP presents a robust solution for local communication infrastructures through its emphasis on simplicity and resilience, enhancing digital participation and networked collaboration in resource-limited contexts.

3. Terminology

Terminator: Blank line (\n\n) [Each message should end with a (\n\n)]

5. Message Types
5.1 PROFILE
Announces a user's identity to the network, including user ID, display name, status, and optional profile picture. This message is periodically broadcast to let peers discover and update contact information. Profile pictures are transmitted in base64 format with MIME type metadata. Any host who does not support profile pictures should be able to accept message that have AVATAR_* keys but will just disregard the AVATAR_* keys.
Format:
TYPE: PROFILE
USER_ID: dave@192.168.1.10
DISPLAY_NAME: Dave
STATUS: Exploring LSNP!
AVATAR_TYPE: image/png
AVATAR_ENCODING: base64
AVATAR_DATA: iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA…
Field Descriptions:
TYPE: Always PROFILE.
USER_ID: Unique sender address [username@ipaddress] 
DISPLAY_NAME: User’s public name.
STATUS: Short message or mood.
AVATAR_TYPE: MIME type of the image. (optional)
AVATAR_ENCODING: Currently always base64.(optional)
AVATAR_DATA: Image data encoded as base64 (under ~20 KB).(optional)
Non-verbose Printing:
Show only the display_name and status. Optionally, show profile picture.
5.2 POST
Sends a public broadcast message to all followers. Non-followers should not receive any posts. Posts are typically used for social updates or announcements. The TTL defines how long the post remains valid, and the token ensures the sender is authorized to broadcast. 
Format:
TYPE: POST
USER_ID: dave@192.168.1.10
CONTENT: Hello from LSNP!
TTL: 3600
MESSAGE_ID: f83d2b1c
TOKEN: dave@192.168.1.10|1728941991|broadcast

6. User Discovery
In LSNP, peer discovery is facilitated through periodic broadcasting of network presence information. Each participating node announces its availability and identity by transmitting two distinct message types—PING and PROFILE—at regular 300-second intervals using broadcast communication. The PING message acts as a lightweight heartbeat signal, informing others on the network that a peer is active and reachable. Meanwhile, the PROFILE message conveys additional metadata such as the peer’s name, capabilities, or status, allowing for richer interaction and recognition among nodes. The default message is PING unless a PROFILE message is sent within the interval. This decentralized mechanism ensures that peers can dynamically detect and update their view of other users within the local network, maintaining an up-to-date and resilient social topology without relying on centralized coordination.

 7. Expiration
Expiration refers to the concept that a token remains valid only for a limited duration after it has been issued. Its main purpose is to prevent the reuse or abuse of tokens once they have outlived their intended timeframe. To validate expiration, the system compares the timestamp embedded in the token against the current time. If the token’s timestamp indicates a time in the past, it is considered expired and must be rejected.

 8. Revocation
Revocation refers to the mechanism that allows a token to be explicitly invalidated before its natural expiration time. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where a user logs out, switches devices, or when suspicious or unauthorized activity is detected.
To implement revocation in LSNP, each peer maintains a lightweight, in-memory revocation list containing token hashes or unique token identifiers. When a peer receives a message accompanied by a token, it consults this list to determine if the token has been previously revoked. If the token appears on the list, the message is rejected, effectively blocking unauthorized or stale sessions from being processed. This approach provides a simple yet effective way to enhance security and control over active tokens in a decentralized environment.


9. Scoping
Scoping defines the set of actions a token is authorized to perform, serving as a mechanism to enforce permission boundaries within a system. Its primary purpose is to contain potential damage in the event a token is leaked or misused. By assigning specific scopes—such as broadcast, post, or dm—to each token, the system ensures that tokens are only used for their intended functions.
In LSNP, enforcing token scopes involves validating the intended operation against the token’s declared scope. For example, if a token is granted the broadcast scope, it should not be permitted to send direct messages (dm). If such a mismatch occurs—where the operation requested exceeds or deviates from the token’s scope—peers must reject the request to maintain protocol integrity and prevent unauthorized actions. This approach upholds strict access controls in decentralized settings.
In the Local Social Networking Protocol (LSNP), a SCOPE defines the area or permission boundary within which a given action (such as a message or token use) is valid. It is especially relevant for token validation and admin commands.
Here are the defined scope values and their meanings:
Scope
Used In
Purpose
chat
DM, REVOKE
Allows sending direct messages to another peer.
file
FILE_OFFER,
FILE_CHUNK
Grants permission to initiate and transmit file transfers.
broadcast
POST, LIKE

game
TICTACTOE_*
Restricts interaction to specific game sessions (e.g., moves, results).
group
GROUP_*, 
Grants permission to create, update, message, or manage groups.




10. Game
In LSNP's decentralized gaming model, all messages are stateless, requiring each peer to maintain its own local copy of the game board without relying on shared session data. To ensure consistency and prevent desynchronization, clients are programmed to silently ignore or reject invalid or conflicting moves. Additionally, peers can implement protective behaviors such as automatically declining repeated game invitations from the same source or disconnecting inactive games after a specified timeout, thereby supporting a smooth and self-regulated user experience within the protocol’s lightweight framework.
Acknowledgement & Retry:
After sending a TICTACTOE_INVITE or TICTACTOE_MOVE, the sender should expect an ACK message containing a unique MESSAGE_ID. If no ACK is received within a short timeout (e.g., 2 seconds), the sender should retry the message up to 3 times.
Duplicate Detection:
Recipients must ensure idempotency by checking for duplicate moves based on GAMEID and TURN. If a duplicate is received, it should be acknowledged again but ignored for game logic.

11. Groups
In LSNP, group functionality is fully decentralized, meaning each peer is independently responsible for maintaining an up-to-date record of group membership. To perform any group-related action—such as sending messages to a group or modifying its state—a valid token with the group scope is required, ensuring that only authorized operations are executed. Group identifiers (IDs) play a critical role in distinguishing groups and are both case-sensitive and expected to be unique within the local network. This approach preserves LSNP’s lightweight and autonomous structure while supporting dynamic, multi-user collaboration.

12. Token Format and Validation
Example:
alice@192.168.1.11|1728943600|game
Validation:
For a token to be considered valid in LSNP, it must meet three critical criteria. First, the token must not be expired; its embedded timestamp must still fall within the acceptable time window, ensuring it hasn’t outlived its intended lifespan. Second, the scope of the token must precisely align with the action being attempted—for example, a token scoped for group cannot be used for a broadcast operation. Third, the token must not appear on the revocation list maintained by the receiving peer; any token flagged as revoked is to be ignored and rejected outright. These three checks—expiration, scope match, and revocation status—must all be satisfied for a token to be accepted and processed by the protocol.

13. Implementation Considerations
In LSNP, binary file chunks and avatar images are encoded using Base64 to ensure they can be safely transmitted within plaintext message structures. This encoding facilitates the inclusion of binary data in the protocol’s key-value format without introducing parsing issues. All messages exchanged between peers must be UTF-8 encoded, ensuring consistent interpretation of textual content across different systems and languages. Furthermore, because LSNP operates in a stateless and decentralized manner, each peer is individually responsible for maintaining its own local record of game state and group membership. This local tracking enables smooth interaction without relying on centralized storage or coordination.

14. Security Considerations
To ensure message authenticity in LSNP, peers should verify the source IP address by comparing the FROM field declared in each message with the actual IP address from which the UDP packet was received. This verification step helps detect spoofed or manipulated source information that could compromise the integrity of peer interactions. If a mismatch is detected—indicating a potential spoofing attempt or network anomaly—the message should either be logged for auditing purposes or silently discarded to prevent unauthorized influence on local state. This safeguard reinforces LSNP’s trust model by making peer identity checks more robust in the absence of encryption.
In LSNP, all network traffic is openly visible to all participating peers, reflecting the protocol’s lightweight and transparent design. By default, no encryption is applied to messages, which simplifies implementation but also introduces the potential for sensitive data to be observed by unintended recipients. Given the lack of cryptographic safeguards, tokens transmitted across the network may be susceptible to spoofing or reuse if intercepted. 

15. Verbose Mode
All LSNP client implementations must support a verbose mode to aid in debugging and development. When enabled, verbose mode should:
Print all incoming and outgoing messages in human-readable format.
Include timestamp, sender IP, and message type in each log entry.
Log all token validations, acknowledgements, packet retransmissions, and dropped packets (if simulated).
Indicate retry attempts for lost Tic Tac Toe moves and file chunks.
Optionally color-code or prefix logs for clarity (e.g., SEND >, RECV <, DROP !).
Verbose mode can be toggled via a command-line flag (e.g., --verbose) or configuration setting.
